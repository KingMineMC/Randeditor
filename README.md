You can change the inventory of the editmod by making your inventory the way you want it and then doing /randeditmode.
Permissions:
randcustomizer.randeditmode (to use editmode)
randcustomizer.randeditmode.set (to manage the editmode)
randcustomizer.randeditmode.bypass (to go outside the plot during edit mode)
